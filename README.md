## About Dio's Extended Resources

Dio's Extended Resources is a utility mod that focuses on adding base items and resources to make mods more compatible.

## Getting Started

Dio's Extended Resources currently add a Nugget variant for each minable resource, as well as a Dust variant.

This will allow Dio's mods suit to use the same base item and reduce the duplication of base items.
